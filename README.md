# Ensemble Learning and Random Forests 🧠🌲

This repository contains a practical implementation of **Ensemble Learning techniques** using **scikit-learn**, based on **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (3rd Edition)** by Aurélien Géron.

The purpose of this project is to build strong intuition around ensemble methods and understand **why and when they outperform single models**.
