Ensemble Learning and Random Forests 🧠🌲

This repository contains a practical implementation of Ensemble Learning techniques using scikit-learn, based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (3rd Edition) by Aurélien Géron.

The purpose of this project is to build strong intuition around ensemble methods and understand why and when they outperform single models.
